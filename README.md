# BCGX-GenAI-Forage-Projects
Repository for BCGX GenAI Forage Virtual Job Simulation Tasks.

This project was completed as part of the BCG GenAI Job Simulation offered through Forage, where I worked on developing an AI-powered financial chatbot. 

In Task 1, I extracted key financial data from the 10-K filings of Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple, manually compiling figures like total revenue, net income, total assets, total liabilities, and cash flow from operating activities across the last three fiscal years. I then performed initial analysis using Python to calculate year-over-year growth rates and summarize financial trends, preparing the data for AI integration.

In Task 2, I developed a rule-based chatbot using Python that interacts with users through predefined financial queries, pulling accurate insights from the structured dataset created in Task 1. The chatbot allows users to select a company, a fiscal year, and ask questions related to financial metrics, providing clear and accurate responses. This simulation provided hands-on experience in financial data handling, Python development, chatbot logic design, and AI-driven financial communication.
