AI-Driven Financial Chatbot Prototype

Overview
This project involves the development of a 'Rule-Based Financial Chatbot' designed to provide users with quick and accurate financial insights based on predefined queries. The chatbot leverages structured financial data from 10-K filings for companies like Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple.

Functionality
- Responds to 15 predefined financial queries related to revenue, net income, assets, liabilities, and cash flows.
- Allows users to select a company and fiscal year (2021, 2022, 2023) for which they wish to retrieve financial information.
- Provides concise and accurate responses based on analyzed data.

Supported Queries
The chatbot can answer queries such as:
- Total Revenue
- Net Income
- Total Assets
- Total Liabilities
- Cash Flow from Operating Activities
- Growth percentages for revenue, net income, assets, liabilities, and cash flows
- Year-by-year average growth rates for each metric

Limitations
- Only supports data from Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple.
- Only for fiscal years 2021â€“2023.
- Only predefined queries are supported (no open-ended conversations).
- Requires CSV files (`final_financial_data_report.csv` and `Summary_financial_report.csv`) to be present.
